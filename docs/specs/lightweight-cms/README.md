## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 & 2 Lessons Learned

**Phase 1:**
- **ConvexDB Schema**: The minimalist approach works well - storing only essential metadata while leveraging Uploadthing for file management
- **Component Architecture**: Separating Admin/Public/Shared components provides good organization and reusability
- **Development Workflow**: Using `npm run cms:dev` for concurrent development of both frontend and backend is efficient
- **API Design**: Full-text search and real-time subscriptions are well-supported by ConvexDB

**Phase 2:**
- **Route Parameter Handling**: Need to handle "new" as a special case for create operations vs. actual IDs for editing
- **TypeScript Integration**: Convex's generated types work excellently with React hooks for type safety
- **Real-time Updates**: ConvexDB's real-time features eliminate complex state management needs
- **Admin UX**: Clean, intuitive admin interfaces significantly improve content management efficiency
- **Hook Pattern**: Custom hooks for each entity (publications, users, media) provide excellent code organization
- **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries and user feedback are crucial for admin interfaces

### Recent Implementation Updates (Latest Commits)
